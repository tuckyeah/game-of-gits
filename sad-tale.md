House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Unfortunately, GRRM is a hateful person and honor never works for anyone so
Ned loses his head and dies. Bummer.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

(Spoiler: Joffrey dies.)
